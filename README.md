# EZ-VI

EZ-VI is a program that tries to facilitate the scripting of the Vi
text editor

For now, EZ-VI is in early development. This means that it has no
API nor command line interface.

## Usage

Since the project is not finished, you will have to edit the file
`ez_vi.py` under the `ez_vi` directory.

The functions that are available have not been documented yet.
Please see the [Vi tools](https://github.com/TrickyTroll/EZ-VI/blob/62a368fa576705a0d90f01d5d25059f30788a557/ez_vi/funcmodule.py#L163)
