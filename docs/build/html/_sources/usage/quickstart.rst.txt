Quickstart
==========

After installing this program, you can easily start using ``ezvi`` by using the
``text`` command. ``text`` is only going to re-type a premade text file. It can
be any text file. From configuration files to programs, it does not matter as
long as its a text file.

.. code-block::

  ezvi text [PATH/TO/TEXT/FILE]

For more information on what is possible with ``ezvi``, see the 
:doc:`actions <actions>` section.
