Installation
============

``EZ-VI`` is distributed as a `Pip package <https://pypi.org/project/ezvi/>`_. 
To install the program, simply run

.. code-block:: bash 

  pip install ez-vi

This will install the package to your current environnement.

.. note:: If you are starting a new project, it is recommended that you
  create a new environnement. This ensures that your workspace does not
  get too cluttered by accumulating packages that are not useful to your
  current project. Instructions on how to work with environnements with
  python can be found `here <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_.
